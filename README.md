Converts evaluation specifications written with markdown to xlsx table.

## Usage 

### Write Markdown

Write markdown as follows 
```test_spec.md
# Category

2. Test process 2

```
Now h1, h2, h3, h4, itemization(1., 2. ... n.) and check marks(*[ ]) are supported.

* A h1 element means evaluation category. This will be converted to a sheet in xlsx.
* A h2, h3 and h4 element mean major item, middle item and minor item respectively.
* Items beggining with "n." mean test procedures.
* Items beggining with "* [ ]" mean check points of this test.

## Limitations

Now, headers in converted xlsx table are Japanese only.
